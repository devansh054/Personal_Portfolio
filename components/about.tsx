                Hi, I'm Devansh Khatri ðŸ‘‹ â€” a Software Engineering student at the University of Guelph with a passion
                for building systems that perform under pressure.
              </p>

                I've engineered a real-time equities trading platform capable of handling 10,000+ concurrent
                transactions, designed REST APIs with Spring Security handling 1,000+ requests per minute, and built a
                multiplayer trading simulation with live WebSocket updates and risk management controls. My projects
                blend backend scalability with frontend usability, often powered by Java, Spring Boot, Docker,
                PostgreSQL, and React.

                Beyond projects, I've worked in IT support roles at Walmart, the University of Guelph, and Sanskriti
                School â€” sharpening my skills in problem-solving, troubleshooting, and communication. I'm especially
                excited about opportunities in backend development, fintech, and real-time systems â€” the kind of work
                where every millisecond and every transaction matters.
